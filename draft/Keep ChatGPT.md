To check if a specific port is in use and identify the process using it in Ubuntu, you can use several tools and commands. Here are a few common methods:

### Using `netstat`
`netstat` is a powerful tool to display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.

1. **Install `netstat` (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install net-tools
   ```

2. **Check the port usage:**
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tuln | grep :<port_number>
   ```

3. **Find the process using the port:**
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :<port_number>
   ```

   Replace `<port_number>` with the port you want to check.

### Using `ss`
`ss` is a utility to investigate sockets, and it's a replacement for `netstat`.

1. **Check the port usage:**
   ```bash
   sudo ss -tuln | grep :<port_number>
   ```

2. **Find the process using the port:**
   ```bash
   sudo ss -tulpn | grep :<port_number>
   ```

### Using `lsof`
`lsof` (list open files) is a command that lists information about files opened by processes.

1. **Install `lsof` (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install lsof
   ```

2. **Check the port usage:**
   ```bash
   sudo lsof -i :<port_number>
   ```

### Example
Suppose you want to check if port 8080 is in use and by which process:

1. **Using `netstat`:**
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :8080
   ```

   This will output something like:
   ```
   tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8080            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1234/nginx
   ```

2. **Using `ss`:**
   ```bash
   sudo ss -tulpn | grep :8080
   ```

   This will output something similar:
   ```
   LISTEN    0         128                0.0.0.0:8080             0.0.0.0:*        users:(("nginx",pid=1234,fd=6))
   ```

3. **Using `lsof`:**
   ```bash
   sudo lsof -i :8080
   ```

   This will output something like:
   ```
   COMMAND  PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
   nginx   1234 root    6u  IPv4  12345      0t0  TCP *:webcache (LISTEN)
   ```

In each case, you can see that port 8080 is being used by the `nginx` process with PID 1234.
