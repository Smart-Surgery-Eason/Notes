### Insert HTML element into HTML by Code
I want to insert this into the HTML by code:
```html
<tr><td>0</td><td><a href="../doc/experiment-00000.md">Document Tracker</a><td></td></td><td>tracker</td><td>running</td></tr>
```
It could be simplified to insert `Hello, World!` into the HTML by code.
To achieve this, I have to do the following:
1. **knowing where I can found the documentation of the HTML manipulation**

|Name|Source|Description|
|-|-|-|
|[W3Schools/html](https://w3schools.com/html)|Google `html`| It's all about html, but I can navigate to [javascript](https://w3scholls.com/javascript) or [jquery](https://w3scholls.com/javascript) sections the do futher, investigation|
|[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)|Google `html`| Many board viewpoints, mentioning W3C and html.spec.whatwg.org as the maintainers, terminology, history, simple tutorial and references. I can navigate to know more about the history.|

|[MDN Sidebar](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)|MDN/Guides|There is no JQuery for the first glance.|
|[JQuery.com](https://jquery.com/)|Google `JQuery`|On `DOM Traversal and Manipulation` > `$( "button.continue" ).html( "Next Step..." )` I create [this project][myproject-jquerybasic-readme].|
