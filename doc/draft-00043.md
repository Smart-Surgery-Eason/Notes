#### **Opening Scene: Discovery of the Indoor Shrimp Pool**

**American Host** (to camera, gesturing around):
*“So, this is Taiwan. Indoor shrimp fishing… Yeah, indoors.”*

*After observing the local family, the Shrimp Pool Owner approaches the American Host with a friendly smile.*

**Shrimp Pool Owner** (warmly):
“Hello! Welcome to our shrimp fishing pool. Have you played shrimp fishing before?”

**American Host** (try to be polite, smile, but smirk):
“Well, back in America, we usually fish on a lake from a boat, just like in the movies—father and son bonding time.”

**Shrimp Pool Owner** (don't understand what is he talking about, keep talking like a robot):
“Let me show you a few tricks. It's all about patience and timing.”

*The Shrimp Pool Owner demonstrates how to properly handle the fishing rod and bait, offering tips with a patient demeanor. The host listens attentively, nodding along.*

**American Host**:
“Thanks, I appreciate the help. Let's see if I can catch one now.”

*The Shrimp Pool Owner leaves the host to try fishing on his own. Despite the guidance, the host struggles to catch any shrimp, growing visibly bored.*

*The camera moves to show a man sitting still, staring at the water, waiting patiently for a shrimp to bite.*

**American Host** (observing the man, with a hint of admiration):
“I think that's how they find their inner peace.”

*The host continues to look around, taking in the atmosphere of the shrimp pool.*

*A montage clip shows the host recalling his childhood with his father on a boat. They were happy, but then his father fell into the water and drowned. The camera returns to the host, whose eyes are red.*

*He is so happy and tries to catch a second shrimp, but no shrimp is on the hook anymore.*

*Cut to the host watching a worker scoop shrimp into a bucket with a net.The camera pan to the host "coming up with an idea."*

*A fisherman nearby, who has been patiently waiting, finally catches 5 or 6 shrimp and smiles with satisfaction.

**American Host** (smiling, playfully):
"Do you know who eats more shrimp?"

*The kid stares blankly, showing a face of "I don't understand English" for several seconds.*

**American Host** (laughing, lifting the shrimp bucket slightly):
"A whale!"

*The host laughs, and the cameraman chuckles too.*

**Cameraman** (amused):
"That's a good one, though. Taiwanese might not get it."

**American Host** (waving his hand casually in front of the camera):
"Let's put some subtitles to explain the joke."

*The camera fades out to another scene.*
