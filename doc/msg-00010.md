- **Message:** @channel all, at the moment, we will set all the github/huggingface repo as private. We must adapt the code review/PR/oss license process before setting any source code as public.  HelloWorld/tutorials are not included.
- **Note:** I should add this rule to somewhere of my document and explain what review/PR/oss is.
