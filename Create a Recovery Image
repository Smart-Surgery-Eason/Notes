Creating a recovery image in Ubuntu involves creating a backup of your current system setup, which you can use to restore your system to its current state if something goes wrong. Here’s a general approach to creating a recovery image in Ubuntu:

### 1. **Use Clonezilla for Disk Imaging**

**Clonezilla** is a popular free and open-source tool for creating disk images. Here’s how you can use it:

1. **Download Clonezilla:**
   - Go to the [Clonezilla website](https://clonezilla.org/) and download the appropriate ISO file for your system (usually the "stable" version).

2. **Create a Bootable Clonezilla USB/DVD:**
   - Use a tool like Rufus (Windows) or Startup Disk Creator (Ubuntu) to create a bootable USB stick or DVD from the Clonezilla ISO.

3. **Boot from Clonezilla:**
   - Insert the Clonezilla bootable media into your computer and restart. You may need to change the boot order in your BIOS/UEFI settings to boot from USB/DVD.

4. **Follow Clonezilla’s Instructions:**
   - Select the “device-image” option to create an image of your disk.
   - Choose the destination where you want to store the image (an external hard drive, network location, etc.).
   - Follow the prompts to select the source disk/partition you want to back up and proceed with the imaging process.

### 2. **Using `dd` Command for Disk Imaging**

The `dd` command can also create a disk image but is less user-friendly and lacks some of Clonezilla's features.

1. **Open Terminal:**

2. **Create an Image:**
   - Run the following command to create an image of your disk:
     ```bash
     sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/path/to/backup/image.img bs=4M
     ```
     Replace `/dev/sdX` with your actual disk (e.g., `/dev/sda`) and `/path/to/backup/image.img` with the path where you want to save the image.

   - Note that `dd` will copy the entire disk, so make sure the destination has enough space.

3. **Verify the Image (Optional):**
   - You can verify the image with:
     ```bash
     sudo dd if=/path/to/backup/image.img bs=4M | md5sum
     sudo md5sum /dev/sdX
     ```
     Compare the checksums to ensure the image is a faithful copy.

### 3. **Creating a System Snapshot with Timeshift**

**Timeshift** is a tool specifically designed for creating and restoring system snapshots in Linux.

1. **Install Timeshift:**
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install timeshift
     ```

2. **Set Up Timeshift:**
   - Launch Timeshift from your application menu.
   - Follow the setup wizard to select the snapshot type (RSYNC or BTRFS) and destination.

3. **Create a Snapshot:**
   - Click on the “Create” button to start creating a snapshot of your system.

4. **Restore from Snapshot (if needed):**
   - If you need to restore, boot into Timeshift from a live USB or select a snapshot from the Timeshift application and follow the restore procedure.

### Summary

- **Clonezilla** is great for a complete disk image with advanced options.
- **`dd`** provides a straightforward but less flexible approach.
- **Timeshift** offers a user-friendly way to manage system snapshots.

Choose the method that best fits your needs and technical comfort level.
